       <p><b>Bulgaria</b> became a full member of the Schengen Area on January 1, 2025. This decision, confirmed by the European Union's interior ministers, marks the culmination of over a decade-long integration process. <b>The move will eliminate land border controls between Bulgaria and the rest of the Schengen zone, facilitating seamless travel and trade.</b> European Commission President hailed the decision, emphasizing that it strengthens and unifies Europe.</p>

       <p>The accession of Bulgaria to the Schengen Area is expected to have significant economic and social benefits. For Bulgaria, economists from the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences estimate a positive financial impact of approximately €800 million annually.<br> <strong>The removal of border checks is anticipated to reduce wait times, lower logistical costs for businesses, and attract foreign investment.</strong> Bulgarian Interior Minister highlighted the country's efforts in securing its borders and combating illegal migration as pivotal in achieving this milestone.</p> 
       <hr/>
       <p>This expansion brings the Schengen Area to a total of <em>29 countries</em>, encompassing over 4.3 million square kilometers and benefiting more than 400 million people. The inclusion of Bulgaria is seen as a step toward a more secure and competitive Europe, enhancing the principles of free movement and cooperation among member states.</p>

    <h1>Welcome to my Final Assignment!</h1>
    <h2>This website serves as a guide to the acoustic guitar, specifically focusing on the G, Em, C, and D chords. 
        These chords are in the key of G and are essential while being relatively easy for a beginner to learn. 
        Below are a few songs that you can play simply by knowing how to play these four chords.</h2>
 </div>
 
 <div class="List";>
    <caption>Some famous songs that use these chords: </caption>
 <ul>
  <li>Good Riddance - Green Day
    <ul>
      <li>These chords are used throughout the entire song.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Someone Like You - Adele
    <ul>
      <li>Adele used G, Em, C, and D chords in her song.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Let It Be - The Beatles
    <ul>
      <li>This world-renowned band has used just these four simple chords in their song.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Country Roads - John Denver
    <ul>
      <li>These chords are used for almost the entire song, with an F chord appearing at the end.</br>
        However, the F chord is so brief that 97% of the song features the four chords mentioned above.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Note that these are simplified versions of the songs for easy strumming and singing.</br>For more authentic versions, 
    visit <a href="https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/" target="_blank">Ultimate Guitar (Advanced Tabs & Chords)</a></br>
     However, be aware that the versions on that site may be significantly harder for a beginner.</p>

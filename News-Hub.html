  <h2>Bulgaria's Monthly News</h2>
  <p>Bulgaria has officially joined the Schengen Zone, 
    marking a historic milestone in the country’s European integration. As of March 31, 2024, 
    Bulgaria, along with Romania, has gained partial Schengen membership, 
    allowing for passport-free travel by air and sea to other Schengen countries. While land border checks remain in place for now, this development is a significant step toward full accession, enhancing mobility for citizens and strengthening Bulgaria’s position within the European Union. </p>
